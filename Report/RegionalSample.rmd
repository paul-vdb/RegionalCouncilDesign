## Executive Summary{-}

* The Department of Conservation has developed a Master Sample for biodiversity monitoring across all of New Zealand. A Master Sample explicitly coordinates monitoring by 
ensuring the scalability and combination of effort across spatial scales as well as explicitly keeping track of sampling effort to allow reduced costs when sampling areas and
objectives overlap. The sample itself is created from Balanced Acceptance Sampling (BAS) which is a modern spatially balanced design which combines the benefits of both systematic
sampling and simple random sampling.

* The Master Sample approach can both augment the existing 8-km systematic grid or should be considered for future monitoring designs where the grid may not be practical. 
@bates2018 showed that combining data from the 8-km grid and the Master Sample does not negatively impact the overall inference about the population. This is for both sample augmentation
when intensifying sampling effort from State of the Environment to management effectiveness monitoring, as well as for contiguous regions where one may implement the 8-km grid and then 
collaborate with a neighbouring region that implemented the Master Sample.

* We propose that due to the heterogeneity of forests in New Zealand and the homogeneity of croplands that make up a large portion of Regional Council lands that stratification could
be implemented to decrease cost while not negatively impacting the overall inference for State of the Environment reporting. Using the Master Sample is flexible and can be tailored to the
needs of the individual council and their landscape while the systematic sample is much more rigid. For example, Southland Regional Council implementing the 8-km grid would need to 
monitor 218 sites. Using stratification for croplands and other areas that are highly impacted by human use, we would recommend a sample size of 165, 53 fewer sites. This is considering
that for all forest and native habitat the 8-km grid sampling intensity is maintained as it has been proven to work.


## Introduction{-}

The Department of Conservation (DOC) has developed a National Level Monitoring (NLM) Programme as part of 
the National Biodiversity Monitoring Programme (NBMP) system, using an
8-km grid at over 1,400 monitoring sites on Public Conservation Land (PCL). The NLM programme focuses on status and 
trend monitoring at the national scale for key indicators of ecological integrity. 
This allows DOC to make statistically valid inference across the entire PCL and report on the State of the Environment (SOE). 

Regional councils are responsible for managing biodiversity off PCL within their territorial boundaries. 
Regional councils have adopted an indicator framework for reporting on ecological integrity aligned with DOC and the NLM.
Monitoring programmes have been implemented off PCL by Greater Wellington Regional Council (GWRC) and Auckland Council (AC). 
Considerable effort has gone into collaborating monitoring between agencies. The Environmental Monitoring and Reporting group (EMAR) 
has been established to coordinate environmental monitoring and reporting efforts between central and local/regional government. 

DOC has continued to developed tools and frameworks to support standardised, well designed and coordinated environmental monitoring within New Zealand. 
We believe regional councils would benefit from these developments with the view to establishing a coordinated, adaptable and fit-for-purpose 
approach to monitoring ecological integrity and the effectiveness of biodiversity management in New Zealand. @bates2018 established the rigorous design
methods for coordinated terrestrial monitoring in New Zealand. The purpose of this document is to introduce the Master Sample [@bates2018] 
in the context of Regional Council SOE monitoring and reporting along with basic design principles to understand the benefits of integrating monitoring between
DOC and each Regional Council.


## Principles of monitoring{-}

For a monitoring programme to be successful it is important to provide clear, detailed documentation of the design decisions made. 
We recommend following the approach described in @reynolds2016road to work through the design decision making process. 
Articulating clear and achievable objectives is critical and drives all of the design decisions that follow. To report on SOE similar to NLM,
we define it as "status and trend" monitoring focussing on large spatial scales (the entire region) and long-term trends (5-10 years).
Status and trend monitoring may allow for inference about ecological integrity across an area but will not necessarily give information about 
short-term management effectiveness in a particular area unless there is a very significant response in the population. 
If a specific monitoring action is undertaken and we are interested in measuring its 
success, we would undertake "effectiveness monitoring". Effectiveness monitoring may result in choosing a BACI (Before-After Control-Impact) design. 
The objectives decide what is measured, where it is measured and how frequently to return. Without clear objectives a monitoring programme will not 
likely be successful and can be a waste of resources if it fails to provide management and stakeholders useful information.

Based on the objectives, conceptual models are used to apply expert knowledge and develop the required indicators and measures that are needed to report 
back on. The indicators and measures that are reported on will identify the target population and sample frame. The target population is defined as the 
population or resource of interest (e.g. all native forest in the region). The sample frame is a spatial representation of the target population (e.g. the best spatial information available representing 
native forests in the region). Once the target population and sample frame are defined it is important to account for any logistical constraints (such as accessibility and safe conditions for field crews) as not all areas can be visited safely. A clear definition of the sample frame is important to ensure that the scope of inference is understood. Steep unsafe areas that are not able to be sampled may exclude unique habitats from the sample.

After choosing what to measure and where it should be measured, sample size/site selecion is undertaken. Sample size should reflect the objectives 
and should be informed on the variability thought to occur in the population being measured. If we suspect biodiversity is reasonably consistent for bird 
communities on pastures in the Canterbury Plains, then a smaller amount of sampling may be required than when monitoring birds in regenerating native 
forest. Sampling locations should be drawn to provide an unbiased representation of the population of interest within the sample frame. 
A probabilistic sample ensures that the sample represents the population as a whole. Convenience or judgement sampling generally does not allow 
for inference over the entire population.

## Objectives{-}

Regional councils have statutory responsibilities for monitoring the SOE and the effectiveness of policies and rules on the maintenance of indigenous biodiversity.

For the purposes of this document we assume the main objective

1. To provide unbiased assessment of the SOE based on indicators from the regional council indicator framework.

However, the framework provided allows for integrating effectiveness monitoring into existing SOE monitoring

2. To determine the effectiveness of policy and management interventions. 

## Recommended Monitoring Design for Regional Councils{-}

In order to integrate monitoring between the Regional Councils and DOC we recommend implementing the New Zealand Master Sample [@bates2018]. A Master Sample
is a large number of sampling locations which have shared properties such that subsamples explicitly accomodate coordination on multiple spatial scales. 
This document compares and contrasts the advantages of the Master Sample over adopting the 8-km grid for Regional Councils who manage diverse ecosystems mixed with 
protected habitats, industry and urban areas. We describe the two designs in the context of the sampling requirements

* Stratification (Forest, Urban, Pasture)
* Multiple Spatial Scales
* Adaptability (inaccessible sites, changing resources etc.)
* Incorporate legacy monitoring
* Coordination between MfE and DOC (LUCAS and NLM (formerly known as Tier 1))

As mentioned in the objectives, the Master Sample approach is flexible enough to be intensified locally for effectiveness monitoring. 

## New Zealand Master Sample{-}

The New Zealand Master Sample was developed by the Department of Conservation [@bates2018] in order to augment existing national level 
programs for the purpose of monitoring management effectiveness at multiple spatial scales. The main benefit of a Master Sample is that it helps
coordinate monitoring between agencies. To start, DOC needed to integrate monitoring effort between district, regional and national
offices. The Master Sample covers all of New Zealand and can be used to coordinate monitoring effort not just within DOC but between DOC and other 
agencies such as Regional Councils or MfE. When all agencies are designing rigorous monitoring programmes, the data can be aggregated with low risk
of bias if the survey methodology is taken into account. However, it is a difficult task to make aggregate data from disjoint surveys with unknown scales
of inference and often uncertain probabilistic/judgement samples. The Master Sample takes care of this because it ensures that the agencies
are using consistent methodology at each spatial scale which allows for larger scale unbiased inference making use of local monitoring programmes. The
ordered numbered samples make it explicit for effort to be shared between agencies with overlapping spatial extents to monitor. That way the two agencies
can work together to sample the area sharing resources and saving money. The Master Sample facilitates coordination but is only a set of sites to choose
a sample from. For it to be implemented the agencies themselves need to communicate about their monitoring programmes. See the Pacific Northwest Aquatic 
Monitoring Partnership (https://www.pnamp.org/static-page/what-tools-do-we-offer) for an example of a Master Sample used for coordinate freshwater monitoring
in Washington State.

The New Zealand Master Sample is simply a Balanced Acceptance Sample (BAS) [@robertson2013bas] applied to the entire country. BAS is a spatially balanced sampling technique 
developed by the University of Canterbury that spreads effort systematically across space generating an infinite number of sites. This means that for any region/spatial scale 
the BAS sample provides a sufficient number of sites. For this reason, it is flexible for any spatial sample that is required by the objectives whether a 
BACI design, or some form of clustered sampling. A BAS sample has an ordering from 1 to infinity. Sites must be visited based on this ordering 
which is how the Master Sample coordinates sampling explicitly from the design side. As mentioned above, if regions overlap then sites can be shared based on this ordering
which maintains an overall BAS sample within and across the sampling areas. Figure \@ref(fig:tasman) shows how the Master Sample can be used to explicitly
coordinate monitoring for DOC at multiple spatial scales as well as augment the 8-km grid.

```

## Existing Monitoring Programmes{-}

The NLM is a systematic sample spread across New Zealand on an 8-km grid with a random start. 
It builds on the Land Use Carbon Analysis System (LUCAS) forest monitoring programme described by @coomes2002designing. With systematic sampling, 
effort is proportional to area. Including a random start makes the NLM a probabilistic sample. This ensures sites are well spread across space
and representative of the entire PCL. The spread of effort improves precision over simple random sampling any time there are strong spatial trends 
in the population. In the rare case that there is a periodic trend in the population that matches the grid, the sampling can be biased. 
There are roughly 1,400 sites on the 8-km grid that are currently monitored for ecological integrity on PCL. Each year, 20% of the sites (randomly selected) 
are monitored on a non-overlapping rotating schedule. Monitoring in this way puts emphasis on capturing spatial variability versus short-term trends. 
The programme captures long-term trends in ecological integrity through repeated sampling every 5-years. The 8-km grid exists across all of 
New Zealand and has been extended to selected Regional Council land, such as GWRC. For the West Coast Region (84% PCL), the largest proportion of Regional Council 
sites on the 8-km grid are on PCL and monitored as part of NLM. In other extremes, such as Otago (497 sites off of PCL and 92 on PCL), a large number 
of grid sites are not on PCL. See Table \@ref(tab:tab1) for the number of sites on and off PCL for each region. Figure 2 shows the 8-km 
grid for the Southland region which is more balanced with 47% of the 8-km grid occurring off of PCL.

Although systematic samples are not very flexible, the 8-km grid is very effective for monitoring biodiversity on a large scale. However, the 8-km grid would not be fit-for-purpose for monitoring of fragmented ecosystems with 
variable areas spread over a broad spatial extent. To facilitate monitoring of management effectiveness DOC has developed a flexible, adaptive approach to monitoring design based on what is known as a Master Sample. A master
sample consists of a large number of sites which can be sub-sampled for a variety of different monitoring programmes. Master Samples are used to coordinate
monitoring between different organizations and have been implemented in the United State (Washington, Oregon and Alaska) as well as Western Canada. Specifically,
the New Zealand Master Sample is a spatially balanced sample with a hierarchical order generated using Balanced Acceptance Sampling (BAS) [@bates2018]. Although spatial spread
is not as good as a systematic sample, the inherent properties of spatially balanced designs offer greater flexibility for varying sample sizes and sample regions than systematic samples. The BAS Master Sample is dense, meaning that there are an infinite number of samples to select
within any sub-region in New Zealand. This allows for it to be relevant at any spatial scale. Using the hierarchical ordering of the Master Sample is how it helps coordinate monitoring.
Sites have a unique ID that matches between different monitoring programmes that have overlapping space and it guarantees that the same sites are selected for both programmes allowing an
automatic sharing of resources. Below shows an example of generating a sample using the Master Sample for the Southland region with a similar sample size to
the 8-km grid. Of note, the Master Sample can be combined with the 8-km grid for estimation as both are unbiased area proportional samples, and this has been shown by simulation [@bates2018].
Using the Master Sample ensures that objective probabilistic monitoring takes places that integrates with future DOC monitoring work and the existing National
Biodiversity Monitoring Programme. In fact, the Master Sample used on PCL explicitly integrates the 8-km grid into any new monitoring programmes.

	kable(tab, caption = "Number of sample locations on the 8-km grid by PCL/non-PCL where Impacted is defined by LUCAS Land Map as Cropland, High producing grassland and Settlements.", booktabs = TRUE)
```

![Southland Region Example of the 8-km grid which yields 495 sites, 277 of which are monitored by the NLM on PCL, and 218 which Southland Regional Council would be responsible for.](images/Tier1Southland.png)

## Stratification{-}

Regional Councils are specifically interested in monitoring all non-PCL in their area, which consist of a diverse matrix of ecosystems and land use types.
Stratification is a powerful tool to improve precision of a sample by focusing more effort in areas that are more variable. 
For instance, native forest will likely be variable across the landscape for bird diversity or plant communities than pasture. A bird monitoring programme that proportionally over represents
forest and under represents pasture will improve precision over a programme with the same sample size but ignoring the difference. Using area proportional sampling, pasture 
would inherently get a larger number of sites selected than is optimal for making inference on both pasture and native forest. In this case, stratification can improve the precision of 
the estimate for the entire region.

Systematic sampling such as the 8-km grid can stratified by changing the grid size in each region. For example, pasture could be sampled every 10-km while native forest every 6-km.
Choosing grid size of 4-km and 16-km would allow for the continued integration of the 8-km grid with intensified, or reduced programmes but provide less 
flexibility to adjust sample effort. The biggest issue here is the inflexbility of sytematic sampling to allow the addition or removal of several sites to be flexible to available resources.
Depending on the landscape, achieving a feasible sample size for the two different stratum may be difficult. In addition to this, once the 8-km grid is deviated from it removes 
the explicit integration with DOC (NLM) and MfE's (LUCAS) existing national programme, which would be the basis for using systematic sampling over a more modern flexible sample method in the first place. 

Using the Master Sample to stratify is very simple. Choose the number of sites in each stratum and then select the first sites in each stratum based on their ordering. Any sample size
can easily be achieved and any stratum, no matter how small area it is will have as many sample sites as required.
Traditional statistical theory recommends that strata should be chosen that are constant through time (e.g. not subject to change). 
Using forest and non-forest can be an issue when some non-forested areas are recovering habitat and may at some point become defined as forested. 
The Master Sample is flexible to account for changing ecosystems to choose strata that are efficient but the spatial extent may need to be adapted in the long-term.

For the purpose of future examples in this document we examined which land use cover types do not occur on PCL based on the LUCAS 
Land Use Map and defined two classes to consider for stratification. Impacted is the union of Settlements, Cropland - Annual, 
Cropland - Perennial, and Grassland - High producing. Native is defined as the rest although it is not truly "native" as it incorporates planted forest and other
introduced land covers. Table \@ref(tab:tab1) shows how many samples occur from the NLM programme on each of these types. Table \@ref(tab:tab2)
breaks down what proportion of each Region is made up of each landcover defined here as a potential stratification layer.

```{r tab2, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
	tab2 <- read.csv("../Sample Size/Data/CoverTypesTable.csv")
	names(tab2) <- c("Region", "Area (km^2)", "% PCL", "% Impacted", "% Native")
	kable(tab2, caption = "Basic breakdown of each Region for PCL and the two stratification classes defined above based LUCAS Land Use Map.", booktabs = TRUE)
```

Choosing a sample size is frequently one of the most complicated parts of desiging a survey. We consider here that the NLM programme has been successful
for SOE monitoring on the PCL. Based on this assumption, the sampling intensity of 8-km grid is considered adequate for Native habitat. We therefore
only need to decide how much sampling effort is required for Impacted areas. 

There are many ways to choose sample size within each strata. Generally, we choose sample sizes that meet some requirement of precision based
on the requirements set out in the objectives. We may use pilot data or expert opinion to inform how many locations to sample. In practical terms,
a budget may be restrict the sample size prior to the deciding but this is risky if it doesn't resource monitoring properly. We had a look at bird data
provided by GWRC, in particular Bellbird, Fantail, and Grey Warbler, to see how the different species varied on the two habitat classes. We observed that
the standard deviation of these birds was roughly twice as large for Native habitats vs Impacted. Using the Neyman Allocation [@strata] we can assign
a sample size for the Impacted region. For standard deviation $s_{Impacted} = 1$ and $s_{Native} = 2$ and $n_{Impacted}$ uknown but $n_{Native}$ equal to the number
of 8-km grid sites on Native habitat in each council we can define the total sample size as
$$
	n = n_{Native}/(2 \times P_{Native}/(2 \times P_{Native} + 1 \times P_{Impacted})).
$$
$P_{Native}$ and $P_{Impacted}$ are the proportion of area in the Region are Native or Impacted. This result is intuitive because sample size depends on
area (the 8-km grid) and heterogeneity (how much bush or farmland is in the Region). Table \@ref(tab:tab3) shows the estimated sample
sizes in each region if we use the Master Sample and stratification. Note that for small Regions such as Nelson, sample sizes are too small to 
be practical and some minimum sample sizes will be needed. Statistically 3 samples is the bare minimum but we would recommend 5.

```{r tab3, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
	tab3 <- read.csv("../Sample Size/Data/SampleSizeTable.csv")
	names(tab3) <- c("Region", "Total Sample", "PCL", "Native RC", "Impacted RC", "Total RC")
	kable(tab3, caption = "Rough sample size suggestions for SOE monitoring for different Regional Councils in New Zealand.", booktabs = TRUE)
```

## Spatial Scales{-}

For many regional councils it is important have a monitoring programme that works at different spatial scales. Some monitoring objectives will include
the ecological response to specific management action. The 8-km grid is set up for status and trend monitoring at a large scale and does not
provide information at a local level. Increasing the sample size of the grid by reducing the grid size is possible and would allow for
localized monitoring. However, as discussed above it would no longer integrate with the larger DOC monitoring program and would then simply be a systematic sample.
Although systematic sampling is an effective way to distribute sampling effort, modern methods of generating probability designs with spatial balance add flexibility and
to the systematic design and are an overall improvement. The Master Sample is able to integrate with the different spatial scales of a monitoring programme making use of the
fact that it is dense (infinite sites at any scale) and has a hierarchical ordering to ensure that sites selected at the larger scale are matched with the localized monitoring
reducing overall effort at the different spatial scales.

## Legacy Monitoring{-}

Often, there are existing monitoring networks that have historical information and/or are currently monitored. Incorporating these sites into
new monitoring programmes improves estimation of trends and can reduce costs if the sites are already resourced. These legacy sites should be
monitored using consistent methodologies and be sampled with some probability. Using the 8-km grid, legacy sites can be included if they fall within some
set distance to a grid point. The grid point site can be replaced with the legacy site. This was implemented by the National Biodiversity Monitoring Programme. 
In contrast, the Master Sample explicitly includes legacy monitoring. If legacy monitoring in an area is adequate, then no Master Sample site may even be used.
The Master Sample is just used to augment sampling to ensure that as a whole the region is sampled at the intensity required by the programme. If a catchment
has a historical program of 10 sites and that catchment makes up 10% of the monitoring area, then a area proportional number of those sites will be randomly selected
to be included into the program and the Master Sample is then used to augment areas with no existing effort.

## Adaptability{-}

Heterogeneity in ecosystems/land cover means there are many sites which may be rejected due to lack of access to private land or the randomly selected site lands
directly on top of a building. Objective, statistically robust methods must be set up to allow for establishing sites in feasible areas when the original sample 
has to be rejected. The NBMP has strict rules to relocate sites from the 8-km grid randomly. The Master Sample has an explicit method
using the hierarchical ordering to relocate sites that fail to fall onto accessible areas. If a site is rejected, a new site in order is available to replace it
maintaining overall spatial balance. Instead of the user needing to re-establish the site randomly, they move down the list of available sites adding the new one 
and removing the missed site. The procedure is simple and requires nothing more than identifying that a site is not able to be sampled.

In the same sense, if a monitoring programme stratifies by forest, pasture, urban and other, then it is possible through new management regimes that the pasture is actively 
managed and moves from pasture to recovering shrub (other) and then finally to forest. These sites may have their own specific programme to monitoring progress of the reforestation. 
Otherwise, through the hierarchical ordering of the Master Sample, a new pasture site is established and then depending on the existing sites ordering it is either dropped from the 
sample or another site in the "other" category is dropped making space for the continued monitoring of this site.

## Coordination{-}

When the 8-km grid is effective and feasible for a regional council to implement then it is very easily coordinated with DOC and other monitoring programmes.
This has been shown by Wellington Regional Council working with DOC to monitor biodiversity on the 8-km grid. The 8-km grid is the first part of any more localised monitoring
on the PCL where the Master Sample and other legacy sites are used to augment/intensify sampling when monitoring for management purposes. The 8-km grid is not very flexible 
and no longer explicitly coordinates monitoring unless multiples of the grid sized are used. For example intensifying the sample to a 4-km grid or reducing it
to a 16-km grid still allows it to fit directly into the overall national grid. However, this either doubles or halves the sample size which may create infeasible options.
The Master Sample was created with the sole purpose of coordinating monitoring. It covers all terrestrial habitats in New Zealand and will be expanded to include freshwater,
an active area of research for DOC in collaboration with the University of Canterbury.

# Conclusions{-}

Although the 8-km grid is an effective sample design for DOC's purpose and some Regional Councils. It may be infeasible or
too inflexible to work for everyone. It is our opinion that using the Master Sample to coordinate and implement monitoring will
both integrate with DOC's current national monitoring programme and DOC's implementation of the Master Sample as well as 
meet any sampling requirements and objectives put forth by the councils. For this reason we recommend the New Zealand Master Sample 
for Regional Council biodiversity monitoring programmes.

The next development for DOC and the New Zealand Master Sample is to incorporate freshwater explicitly into this same design. A recent publication using
Halton Iterative Partitioning [@robertson2018] allows for the sampling of a linear network within the current Master Sample framework. The benefit here is that
freshwater sites selected by the Master Sample will be paired spatially to terrestrial sites. Although the preliminary work on this has been completed to test feasibility,
it is an ongoing research project to finalize the best approach for sampling the linear network within a selected Halton Frame.

## Southland Case Study{-}

There are 495 8-km grid locations in Southland, 277 of which occur on PCL and are monitored by DOC. This leaves
an additional 218 sites that would be monitored if Southland Regional Council (SRC) implemented the 8-km grid. DOC employs
non-overlapping rotating panels on a 5-year rotation for SOE monitoring. This means that each year SRC
would have to monitor roughly 44 randomly selected sites of the 8-km grid. See the Figure 2 for an example of what that 
may look like.

![Southland Region Example of the 8-km grid single year of sampling, where 44 sites are monitored annually.](images/Tier1SouthlandYear1.png)

Given no resource constraints implementation of monitoring at each of these sample locations would be optimal for monitoring and reporting 
status and trend for the Southland Region and integrating seamlessly with DOC's NBMP. We recognise that resource constaints are a major 
impediment to uptake of aligned monitoring for many partner agencies, including SRC. In order to scale sample size to 
match resource constraints using systematic sampling approaches the 8-km grid could be reduced to a 16 or 32-km grid, this would reduce the 
sample size in the Southland Region from 218 to 109 and 54 respectively. Using the Master Sample to derive sample locations for the Southland 
Region is conceptually simpler and more flexible than scaling a systematic sample based on the 8-km grid. Simply use all of the Southland region 
not covered by PCL and apply the Master Sample to derive **N** sample locations. Additionally, site specific monitoring can be derived from the 
Master Sample. This means sample locations for regional status and trend monitoring overlapping with intensively managed sites can contribute to 
site specific estimates of monitored parameters. If more (or less) sample locations are needed in the future this can be easily accommodated 
without compromising the initial sample locations implemented from the Master Sample.

Using the Neyman Allocation for sample size as described above we calculate the following:
$p_{Impacted} = 21.9\%$, $p_{Native} = 78.1\%$, $n_{native} = 389$ and we still assume that variability is half on impacted than native areas.
Then
$$
	n_{total} = 389/(2*78.1/(2*78.1 + 1*21.9)) = 389/0.877 = 444
$$

Therefore, in what we have defined as "Native" habitat we would sample 389 sites (277 by DOC on PCL and 112 by SRC) and 55 "Impacted" sites.
Below, Figure 3 shows the full sample with Master Sample sites across Southland Region. Figure 4 shows the first year of monitoring. We recommend
that if SRC is interested in implementing this monitoring programme that final spatial processing is completed and the strata used are discussed and
these sample sizes recalculated. We intend them to give a rough estimate of what stratification can look like for SRC.

![Southland Region Example of the Master Sample with 389 sites - 277 PCL, 167 Southland Regional Council.](images/StratifiedSouthland.png)

![Southland Region Example of the Master Sample showing year 1 of the sites, 11 Impacted and 23 Native.](images/StratifiedSouthlandYear1.png)

Because we have an infinite number of sites that make up the Master Sample in Southland, all of which are ordered, we are able to move down our
site list when a site needs to be replaced. For example, if one of the selected sites cannot be sampled because a farmer refuses access to their private
land then that site is replaced by a new Master Sample site further down the list. This keeps the site replacement completely objective and the 
full sample intact. Whenever this occurs the scale of inference for the entire study is reduced to "accessible" land but this is typical for these
types of study and the hope is that there are not fundamental differences in these areas that bias the study.

For SRC the benefit of using the Master Sample over the 8-km grid is that; 

1. If stratification is impelmented they have reduced costs.
2. Sample size can be flexibly scaled to adjust to resource constraints.
3. Regional monitoring of status and trend contributes explicitly to monitoring of intensively managed sites.
4. The Master Sample can be used to intensify regional status and trend monitoring in sites of specific interest.
5. Site replacement for non-target areas is built into the sampling procedure.
