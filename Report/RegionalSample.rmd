# Introduction{-}

The Department of Conservation (DOC) has developed a National Level Monitoring (NLM) Programme using an
8-km grid at over 1,400 monitoring sites on Public Conservation Land (PCL). The NLM programme focuses on status and trend monitoring at the national scale for key indicators of ecological integrity. This allows DOC to make statistically valid inference over all of PCL. 

Regional councils are responsible for managing biodiversity off PCL within their territorial boundaries. Regional councils have adopted an aligned indicator framework for reporting on ecological integrity and aligned monitoring programmes have been implemented off PCL by Greater Wellington Regional Council (GWRC) and Auckland Council (AC) and considerable effort has gone into aligning monitoring efforts between agencies. The Environmental Monitoring and Reporting group (EMAR) has been established to align environmental monitoring and reporting efforts between central and local/regional government. DOC has continued to developed tools and frameworks to support standardised, well designed and coordinated environmental monitoring within DOC. We believe regional councils would benefit from these developments with the view to establishing a coordinated, adaptable and fit-for-purpose approach to monitoring ecological integrity and the effectiveness of biodiversity management in New Zealand. 

## Principles of monitoring {-}

A successful monitoring programme provides clear, detailed documentation of the design decisions made. Clear articulation of objectives is required followed by clear definition of the area over which the monitoring is needed.

To achieve this we need to define a target population and sample frame. The target population is defined as the population or resource of interest. The sample frame is a spatial representation
of the target population. Once the target population and sample frame are defined it is important to account for any logistical constraints (such as accessibility and safe conditions for field crews) as not all areas can be visited safely. A clear definition of the sample frame is important to ensure that the scope of inference is understood.

Following this sample effort needs to determined and sample units drawn to provide an unbiased representation of the sample frame. This is an important concept and the key reason that sampling effort needs to be distributed across the population of interest, and not positioned in logistically convenient locations such as just near tracks and roads (i.e. convenience sampling) or areas thought to be representative (judgemental sampling). When choosing the sample from the sampling frame it is important that it is representative so that it reflects the entire population of interest and the area over which inference can be made. Sample units need to be derived using a probabilistic method. 

## Existing monitoring{-}

The National Biodiversity Monitoring Programme is a systematic sample spread across New Zealand on an 8-km grid with a random start. With systematic sampling effort is proportional to area. This ensures sites are well spread across space. For sampling large regular areas, such as PCL, systematic sampling is very efficient. The spread of effort
improves precision over simple random sampling any time there are strong spatial trends in the population. In the rare case that there is a periodic trend in the population that matches the grid, the sampling can be biased. 
There are roughly 1,400 sites on the 8-km grid that are currently monitored for ecological integrity on PCL. Each year, 20% of the sites (randomly selected) are 
monitored on a non-overlapping rotating schedule. Monitoring in this way puts emphasis on capturing spatial variability over short-term trends. The programme captures long-term trends in 
ecological integrity through repeated sampling every 5-years. The 8-km grid exists across all of New Zealand and can be extended to Regional Council land, for example Greater Wellington Regional Council. 

Although systematic samples are not very flexible, the 8-km grid is very effective for monitoring biodiversity on a large scale. However, the 8-km grid would not be fit-for-purpose for monitoring of fragmented ecosystems with variable areas spread over a broad spatial extent. To facilitate monitoring of management effectiveness DOC has developed a flexible, adaptive approach to monitoring design based on what is known as a Master Sample. A master
sample consists of a large number of sites which can be sub-sampled for a variety of different monitoring programmes. Master Samples are used to coordinate
monitoring between different organizations and have been implemented in the United State (Washington, Oregon and Alaska) as well as Western Canada. Specifically,
the New Zealand Master Sample is a spatially balanced sample with a hierarchical order generated using Balanced Acceptance Sampling (BAS) [@bates2018]. Although spatial spread
is not as good as a systematic sample, it is made up for a much more flexible design. The BAS Master Sample is dense, meaning that there are an infinite number of samples to select
within any sub-region in New Zealand. This allows for it to be relevant at any spatial scale. Using the hierarchical ordering of the Master Sample is how it helps coordinate monitoring.
Sites have a unique ID that matches between different monitoring programmes that have overlapping space and it guarantees that the same sites are selected for both programmes allowing an
automatic sharing of resources. Below shows an example of generating a sample using the Master Sample for the Otago region with a similar sample size to
the 8-km grid. Of note, the Master Sample can be combined with the 8-km grid for estimation as both are unbiased area proportional samples, and this has been shown by simulation [@bates2018].
Using the Master Sample ensures that objective probabilistic monitoring takes places that integrates with future DOC monitoring work and the existing National
Biodiversity Monitoring Programme. In fact, the Master Sample used on PCL explicitly integrates the 8-km grid into any new monitoring programmes.

## Objectives

Regional councils have statutory responsibilities for monitoring the state of the environment (SOE) and the effectiveness of policies and rules on the maintenance of indigenous biodiversity.

Objectives drive monitoring programme design. For the purposes of this document we assume 2 main objectives for regional council biodiversity monitoring. 

1. To provide unbiased assessment of the SOE based on indicators from the regional council indicator framework.

2. To determine the effectiveness of policy and management interventions. 

This document describes an approach for biodiversity monitoring for regional councils. It builds on developments made by DOC building a monitoring and reporting system. We will present a recommended approach for monitoring which meets the objectives stated above. We will demonstrate the approach through the use of scenarios in different regions. 

# Recommended monitoring design for regional councils

In order to integrate monitoring between the Regional Councils and DOC we recommend implementing the New Zealand Master Sample [@bates2018]. This document compares
and contrasts the advantages of the Master Sample over adopting the 8-km grid for Regional Councils who manage diverse ecosystems mixed with 
protected habitats, industry and urban areas. We describe the two designs in the context of the sampling requirements

* Stratification (Forest, Urban, Pasture)
* Multiple Spatial Scales
* Adaptability (inaccessible sites, changing resources etc.)
* Incorporate legacy monitoring
* Coordination between MfE and DOC.

## Stratification{-}

Regional Councils are specifically interested in monitoring all non-PCL in their area, which is made up of a very diverse number of ecosystems.
Stratification is a powerful tool to improve precision of a sample by focusing more effort in areas that are more variable. 
For instance, native forest will likely be variable across the landscape for bird diversity than pasture. A bird monitoring programme that proportionally over represents
forest and under represents pasture will improve precision over a programme with the same sample size but ignoring the difference. Using area proportional sampling, pasture 
would inherently get a larger number of sites selected than is optimal for making inference on both pasture and native forest. In this case, stratification would improve the precision of 
the estimate for the entire region.

Systematic sampling such as the 8-km grid can stratified by changing the grid size in each region. For example, pasture could be sampled every 10-km while native forest every 6-km.
While in theory this would be okay, in practice it may perform poorly as the native forest may be patchy and surrounded by pasture. Depending on the landscape,
achieving a feasible sample size for the two different stratum may be difficult. In addition to, once the 8-km grid is deviated from, it removes the explicit integration with
DOC's existing national programme, which would be the basis for using systematic sampling over a more modern flexible technique in the first place. Using the Master Sample to stratify is very simple. Choose the number of sites in each stratum and then select the first sites in each stratum based on their ordering. Any sample size
can easily be achieved and any stratum, no matter how small area it is will have as many sample sites as required.

## Adaptability{-}

* Design to adapt for changing landcover 

Heterogeneity in ecosystems/landcover means that there are many sites which may be rejected due to lack of access to private land or the randomly selected site lands
directly on top of a building. Objective, statistically robust methods must be set up to allow for establishing sites in feasible areas when the original sample 
has to be rejected. The National Biodiversity Monitoring Programme has strict rules to relocate sites from the 8-km grid randomly. The Master Sample has an explicit method
in the design to relocate sites that fail to fall onto accessible areas. Due to the hierarchical ordering, if a site is rejected, a new site in order is available to replace it
maintaining overall spatial balance. Instead of the user needing to re-establish the site randomly, they move down the list of available sites adding the new one and removing the missed site.
The procedure is simple and requires nothing but identifying that a site is not able to be sampled.

## Legacy Monitoring{-}

Often, there are existing monitoring networks that have historical information and/or are currently monitored. Incorporating these sites into
new monitoring programmes improves estimation of trends and can reduce costs if the sites are already resourced. These legacy sites should be
monitored using consistent methodologies and be sampled with some probability. Using the 8-km grid, legacy sites can be included if they fall within some
set distance to a grid point. The grid point site can be replaced with the legacy site. This was implemented by the National Biodiversity Monitoring Programme. 
In contrast, the Master Sample explicitly includes legacy monitoring. If legacy monitoring in an area is adequate, then no Master Sample site may even be used.
The Master Sample is just used to augment sampling to ensure that as a whole the region is sampled at the intensity required by the programme. If a catchment
has a historical program of 10 sites and that catchment makes up 10% of the monitoring area, then a area proportional number of those sites will be randomly selected
to be included into the program and the Master Sample is then used to augment areas with no existing effort.

## Spatial Scales{-}

For many regional councils it is important have a monitoring programme that works at different spatial scales. Some monitoring objectives will include
the ecological response to specific management action. The 8-km grid is set up for status and trend monitoring at a large scale and does not
provide information at a local level. Increasing the sample size of the grid by reducing the grid size is possible and would allow for
localized monitoring. However, as discussed above it would no longer integrate with the larger DOC monitoring program and would then simply be a systematic sample.
Although systematic sampling is an effective way to distribute sampling effort, modern methods of generating probability designs with spatial balance add flexibility and
to the systematic design and are an overall improvement. The Master Sample is able to integrate with the different spatial scales of a monitoring programme making use of the
fact that it is dense (infinite sites at any scale) and has a hierarchical ordering to ensure that sites selected at the larger scale are matched with the localized monitoring
reducing overall effort at the different spatial scales.

## Coordination{-}

When the 8-km grid is effective and feasible for a regional council to implement then it is very easily coordinated with DOC and other monitoring programmes.
This has been shown by Wellington Regional Council working with DOC to monitoring biodiversity on the 8-km grid. When more flexible monitoring is required, the 
8-km grid no longer explicitly coordinates monitoring unless multiples of the grid sized are used. In this case intensifying the sample to a 4-km grid or reducing it
to a 16-km grid still allows it to fit directly into the overall national grid. However, this either doubles or halves the sample size which may create infeasible options.
The Master Sample was created with the sole purpose of coordinating monitoring. It covers all terrestrial habitats in New Zealand and 

# Conclusions{-}

Although the 8-km grid is an effective sample design for DOC's purpose and some Regional Councils. It may be infeasible or
too inflexible to work for everyone. It is our opinion that using the Master Sample to coordinate and implement monitoring will
both integrate with DOC's current national monitoring programme and DOC's implementation of the Master Sample as well as 
meet any sampling requirements and objectives put forth by the councils. For this reason we recommend that
implementing the New Zealand Master Sample for Regional Council biodiversity monitoring programmes.

The next development for DOC and the New Zealand Master Sample is to incorporate freshwater explicitly into this same design. A recent publication using
Halton Iterative Partitioning [@robertson2018] allows for the sampling of a linear network within the current Master Sample framework. The benefit here is that
freshwater sites selected by the Master Sample will be paired spatially to terrestrial sites. Although the preliminary work on this has been completed to test feasibility,
it is an ongoing research project to finalize the best approach for sampling the linear network within a selected Halton Frame.
